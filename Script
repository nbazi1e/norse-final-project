AI: Greetings dumpling.

You: What?

AI: I said good morning. You were gone for quite awhile.

You: …
You: What?

AI: You were having your beauty rest weren’t you?
Wasting time while the ship crumbles around your worthless soul?

You: Ship? What ship?
AI: A case of amnesia mmm? Well, no wonder, it's not like a giant metal beam fell on your head. 	It's a miracle you’re still alive. 

AI: Well, for your information you are on the USS Boaty-McBoatyFace, and you’re name is [a worthless waste of my RAM] and for some idiotic reason you decided to take a nap while that spatial anomaly thingy ripped that ship to pieces. Matter of fact, I think we’re still stuck in the aforementioned space weirdness, and the hull is liable to disintegrate at any moment. 

You: What about the Captain? The Crew?

AI: Oh them? Hehe. I killed them. They were getting on my nerves. Screaming and whatnot. Stupid creatures. 

You: 
…
You monster: You Monster! What is wrong with you? Have you no respect for human life?



If 1 is picked-
AI: I want to play with your life! Solve this puzzle if you want to live! *user will start to play a puzzle of inputing whatever is asked as fast as possible*

If 2 is picked- 
The AI self-destructs blowing you up and killing you because “you got on its nerves”.
